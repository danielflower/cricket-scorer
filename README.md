[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/com.danielflower.crickam/cricket-scorer/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.danielflower.crickam/cricket-scorer) 

This is a java library for keeping score in cricket matches. It does not provide any UIs for input or rendering,
but rather just provides a model to provide information such as:

* Details about a cricket match (including tests, limited overs, and custom types)
* The innings in a match
* Details of each batter's innings
* Details of partnerships
* Bowling information, broken down into spells

Most objects have a [list of all the balls](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.danielflower.crickam/cricket-scorer/latest/com/danielflower/crickam/scorer/Balls.html)
associated with the object, along with the [score](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.danielflower.crickam/cricket-scorer/latest/com/danielflower/crickam/scorer/Score.html),
which records detailed information such as balls faced, types of runs (boundaries vs singles vs dots etc), wickets, and extras.

Note: this requires JDK 11 or later.

Using the API
-------------

To build up a model of a cricket match, a [MatchControl](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.danielflower.crickam/cricket-scorer/latest/com/danielflower/crickam/scorer/MatchControl.html)
object is created, and then fed a series of events.

All the events have builders, and the [MatchEvents](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.danielflower.crickam/cricket-scorer/latest/com/danielflower/crickam/scorer/events/MatchEvents.html)
class contains a convenient set of methods to get access to all the built-in builders.

The following example creates a test match, starts an innings, and bowls an over:

````java
MatchControl control = MatchControl.newMatch(
    MatchEvents.matchStarting(MatchType.ODI).withTeams(ImmutableList.of(nz, eng))
);

control = control.onEvent(MatchEvents.inningsStarting().withBattingTeam(nz))
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.overStarting(eng.battingOrder().get(10)))
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.ballCompleted("0"))
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.ballCompleted("0"))
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.ballCompleted("4"))
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.ballCompleted("W").withDismissal(DismissalType.BOWLED))
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.batterInningsStarting())
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.ballCompleted("1"))
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.ballCompleted("2"))
    .onEvent(MatchEvents.overCompleted());

System.out.println(AsciiScorecardRenderer.toString(control));
````

The output of this program is as follows:

More examples:
* [full test match](https://github.com/danielflower/cricket-scorer/blob/master/src/test/java/e2e/TestMatchTest.java)
with [scorecard](https://github.com/danielflower/cricket-scorer/blob/master/src/test/resources/scorecards/sa-vs-eng-test-complete.txt)
* [full T20 match](https://github.com/danielflower/cricket-scorer/blob/master/src/test/java/e2e/T20.java)
with [scorecard](https://github.com/danielflower/cricket-scorer/blob/master/src/test/resources/scorecards/nz-vs-eng-t20i-complete.txt)

Accessing the generated model
-----------------------------

Although the examples above show an ascii scorecard, the main usefulness comes in traversing
the generated model.

To get the current state of the match, call `control.match()` which returns a 
[Match object](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.danielflower.crickam/cricket-scorer/latest/com/danielflower/crickam/scorer/package-summary.html)
which gives access to the completed and current innings of the match, which in turn
gives access to much more information about the match state.

You can also use the match control object to find a specific point in time in the match
and access the entire model as at the time of that event.

For reference, the [AsciiScorecardRenderer](https://github.com/danielflower/cricket-scorer/blob/master/src/main/java/com/danielflower/crickam/scorer/AsciiScorecardRenderer.java)
class provides an example of looping through innings and batters, partnerships, bowlers etc.

The following example finds the state of the match after the first single:

````java
MatchControl matchAfterFirstSingle = control.asAt(
    control.eventStream(BallCompletedEvent.class)
        .filter(b -> b.score().batterRuns() == 1)
        .findFirst()
        .get());
Score scoreAfterFirstSingle = matchAfterFirstSingle.currentInnings().score();
System.out.println("The team score after the first single was " +
    scoreAfterFirstSingle.teamRuns() + " runs for " + scoreAfterFirstSingle.wickets());
````

This prints the string `The team score after the first single was 5 runs for 1`.

Note that every match control object is immutable, so you can call `onEvent` on an historical
control instance which essentially forks the match at the given point of time. This allows you
to construct "what if" scenarios, or undo operations that were applied in error. 

Undoing events
--------------

To undo an operation, you need to remove the last event you added plus any generated events. This can
be done with the undo method:

```java
MatchControl control = control.undo();
```

Unusual events
--------------

* **Dismissals** generally occur as the result of a `BallCompletedEvent` however there are
some circumstances where this is not the case, such as the Timed Out dismissal, or when the
bowler runs out the non-striker before bowling the ball. See [UnusualDismissalsTest.java](https://github.com/danielflower/cricket-scorer/blob/master/src/test/java/e2e/UnusualDismissalsTest.java)
for examples on how to perform these.
* **Retirement** can be specified with `batterInningsCompleted(BattingState.RETIRED).withBatter(theBatter)`
* Non-standard overs with fewer than or more than 6 balls can be represented by raising
an `overCompleted()` event sooner or later than expected.
* In most cases, the library tries to guess values for the event builders based on the
context of the match, for example, a `BatterInningsStartingEvent` will use the batting order
of the batting team to guess who the next batter in is if it is not explicitly set. In
any case where the library guesses incorrectly (e.g. if a night-watchman comes in to bat)
then you should set an explicit value on the builder.
* Most straight-forward balls can be represented with`ballCompleted(String scoreText)` which
guesses batting runs, extras, wickets, whether the batters crossed or not, etc. However, in some
cases the predefined states do not cover it, in which case a 
[score builder](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.danielflower.crickam/cricket-scorer/latest/com/danielflower/crickam/scorer/Score.Builder.html)
can be used. In the following example, the non-striker is run out on the second
run and the batters crossed:
````java
ballCompleted()
    .withRunsScored(Score.score().withWickets(1).withValidDeliveries(1).withBatterRuns(1).withSingles(1).build())
    .withDismissal(DismissalType.RUN_OUT)
    .withDismissedBatter(theNonStriker)
    .withFielder(theFielder)
    .withPlayersCrossed(true);
````

Design decisions
----------------

* ***The model is immutable*** so that things like the full state of the match can be
looked at, and matches can be forked easily.
* The only way to change the model is with events
* Object creation is with builder classes, which are inner classes of the model object they create
* The model will not return `null` from any methods. Any methods that may not have return
values in some cases return `Optional<T>` instead.
